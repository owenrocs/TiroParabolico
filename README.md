# TiroParabolico

For this game, the following libraries were applied: 'turtle graphics' and 'random'

Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle

This game consists on a cannon shooting balls against targets in motion.

Our goals were:
+  Speed up the ball and the targets
+  Make the game infinite (originally it stopped when a target crossed the screen)
